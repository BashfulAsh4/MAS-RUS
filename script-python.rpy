# Monika's Python Tip of the Day (PTOD)
#
# I probably will be adding many of these, so For the sake of organization
# this is kept separate from script-topics.
#
# NOTE: these are considered pool type events, similar to writing tips
# NOTE: these are also NOT literally once a day. There is a day in between
#   unlocking the next one, though
#
# And to keep the theme, these are 0-indexed
#
# META: Python things to talk about:
# DONE:
#   0 - intro
#   1 - what is python?
#   --- sugestion python compared to other languages/ how does it work
#   --- suggestion mention syntax and probably how to get python maybe separate each part
#   2 - types
#       - numbers and strings, bools and Nones
#   3 - interpreted language
#   5 - comparisons and booleans
#   6 - Variables and assignment
#   8 - Literals
#   9 - Truth Values
#
# TODO:
#   4 - Python sytnax ?
#   7 - variable sizes
#   3 - If statement / elif and else
#   4 - while loop
#   5 - for loop
#   6 - functions
#   7 - functions continiued?
#   10 - Evaluation order and short circuting
#   ? - classes (might be too much) -- Definitely too much, we should probably stick to functional programming
#   ? - modules (might be too much) / importing? -- mention importing only, module making is too much
#   ? - lists
#   11 - dict
#   12 - tuples
#   13 - py2 vs py3
#   14 - String operations
#   15 - start talking about renpy
#
#   Implement advanced python tips for users who have some experience (persistent._mas_advanced_py_tips)
#
# Also what about Renpy?
#
# Another NOTE: We should try to make the topics of an adequate lenght otherwise
# we're just going to throw a lot of info that is going to be ignored or forgotten quickly
# I think splitting something in more than one topic may be a good idea
#
## We can assume evhand is already imported
